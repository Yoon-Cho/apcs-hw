Question 1:What is the main difference between TreeMap and TreeSet, HashMap and HashSet

Set- provides an unordered collection of objects, no duplicates
Map- data structure based on key values and hashing

The main difference is that they implement different interfaces which change their functionality.

A Tree usually has an order in its values through children.
A Hash is not necessarily ordered. They have 'ordering' but not specific numerical order.


Question 2:How are they implemented internally 
Treemaps and Hashmaps implements Map which maps unique keys.
Hashes use the Array interface which repeatedly adds keys.

Question 3:Speed Comparison between HashMap vs Treemap

Hashmap is much faster as it is more simplified than TreeMap but TreeMap is better when order of keys is important.

Question 4:Does Java have a built in heap
Java has PriorityQueue which functions as a heap

Question 5:Implement a running medium using it.
